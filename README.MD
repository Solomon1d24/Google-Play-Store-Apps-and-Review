#This is a data analysis I made during my learning in datacamp 

The theme of this project is the analysis about the relationship between the Android apps' size , price , rating and popularity.

#Data set:

apps.csv : contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.

user_reviews.csv : contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
